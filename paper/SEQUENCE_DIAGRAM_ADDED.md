# ✅ Sequence Diagram Added

## Update Summary

### Added to Research Paper

- ✅ **UML Sequence Diagram** (Figure 2)
  - Shows complete negotiation flow
  - 10 interaction steps documented
  - Loop structure for iterative rounds
  - All 4 components: Frontend, API Gateway, RL Engine, LLM Service

### New Section: "Negotiation Flow"

Located after System Architecture section, includes:

1. **Visual Sequence Diagram** with TikZ
2. **Interaction Protocol** - 6-step detailed breakdown
3. **Component Responsibilities** clearly separated

### Diagram Features

- 📊 4 lifelines (actors)
- ➡️ 10 message arrows with labels
- 🔄 Highlighted negotiation loop (orange box)
- 📝 Parameter details for each message
- ⏱️ Temporal ordering (top to bottom)

### File Updated

`equilibriumx_paper.tex` - Lines 268-340

### What to Do Next

Upload to **Overleaf** and compile to see the sequence diagram in PDF format!

The sequence diagram shows:

1. Session initialization
2. WebSocket connection
3. Configuration setup
4. **Negotiation loop** (repeated):
   - RL agent action selection
   - LLM message generation
   - Environment step execution
   - Real-time UI updates
5. Final results delivery

Now the paper has:

- ✅ Architecture diagram (Figure 1)
- ✅ Sequence diagram (Figure 2) - **NEW!**
- ✅ Convergence chart (Figure 3)
- ✅ 3 Data tables
- ✅ 11 Mathematical equations

**Paper is now complete with all UML diagrams!** 🎉
